The architecture of the banking system is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for flexibility and extensibility as the system evolves over time. The system is based on a client-server model, where clients interact with a central server to perform various banking operations. The server is responsible for managing the data and logic of the system, while the clients provide the interface for the end-users.

The system is divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific set of functions. The modules are designed to be loosely coupled, allowing for easy maintenance and updates. The main modules of the system are:

Account Holder: This module is responsible for managing the user accounts and their personal information. It provides functionality for creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts, as well as managing the login and authentication process.

Account: This module is responsible for managing the user's financial information, such as their balance and transaction history. It provides functionality for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds, as well as viewing transaction history and generating account statements.

Bank Transaction: This module is responsible for processing and validating transactions between accounts. It provides functionality for checking account balances, validating account numbers, and ensuring that transactions are completed successfully.

Bank: This module is responsible for managing the overall operation of the bank, including its policies and procedures. It provides functionality for setting interest rates, managing fees and charges, and generating financial reports.

ATM: This module is responsible for managing the ATM machines located at various branches of the bank. It provides functionality for withdrawing cash, checking account balances, and other basic banking operations.

The communication between the modules is managed through a well-defined set of APIs, allowing for easy integration with other systems and services. The system is built using modern software development frameworks and tools, ensuring high performance, security, and reliability.

Overall, the architecture of the banking system is designed to meet the needs of a modern, digital banking environment, while also providing a flexible and extensible platform for future growth and development
