ATM Project
Overview
The ATM project is a simple command-line application that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) with basic banking functionalities such as withdrawal, deposit, transfer, and transaction history.

Functional Requirements
The ATM should be able to perform the following functions:

Authenticate a user with a valid user ID and user PIN.
Allow the user to view their transaction history.
Allow the user to withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient funds.
Allow the user to deposit money into their account.
Allow the user to transfer money to another account, provided they have sufficient funds and the destination account exists.
Quit the application.
Non-Functional Requirements
The ATM should be easy to use and navigate, with clear instructions and prompts for the user.
The application should be secure and validate user input to prevent malicious actions or errors.
The application should be reliable and handle errors or exceptions gracefully.
The application should be fast and responsive, with minimal delay between user actions and feedback.
Use Cases
Authentication
The user enters their user ID and user PIN.
The application validates the user's credentials and grants access if they are correct.
If the user enters incorrect credentials, the application denies access and prompts the user to try again or quit.
Transaction History
The user selects the "Show Transaction History" option.
The application displays a list of the user's past transactions, including the date, time, type, and amount.
The user can scroll through the transaction history or quit back to the main menu.
Withdrawal
The user selects the "Withdraw" option.
The application prompts the user to enter the amount they wish to withdraw.
The application validates that the user has sufficient funds and allows the transaction if they do.
The application deducts the withdrawal amount from the user's account and dispenses cash if applicable.
The application displays a confirmation message and returns to the main menu.
Deposit
The user selects the "Deposit" option.
The application prompts the user to enter the amount they wish to deposit.
The application adds the deposit amount to the user's account.
The application displays a confirmation message and returns to the main menu.
Transfer
The user selects the "Transfer" option.
The application prompts the user to enter the destination account number and the amount to transfer.
The application validates that the user has sufficient funds and that the destination account exists.
The application deducts the transfer amount from the user's account and adds it to the destination account.
The application displays a confirmation message and returns to the main menu.
Quit
The user selects the "Quit" option.
The application displays a confirmation message and terminates.
System Architecture
The ATM project is implemented in Java and consists of several classes:

AccountHolder: Represents a bank account holder with a user ID and user PIN.
Account: Represents a bank account with an account number and balance.
BankTransaction: Provides transaction functions such as transfer and transaction history.
Bank: Represents a bank with an account holder and an account.
ATM: Provides user interface and functionality with a Bank instance.
ATMProject: Main program entry point.
Future Improvements
The ATM project can be improved with the following features:

Enhanced security measures such as biometric authentication or two-factor authentication.
More detailed transaction history with filtering and sorting options.
Multi-language support for international users
